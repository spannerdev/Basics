## Goals
The main goal of the project is to re-implement all vanilla commands into Basics, including short aliases for common commands (e.g. `/gmc`). The project also takes inspiration from [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net).
Furthermore, all commands, features, and permissions should be completely configurable. Finally, it should be as light-weight as possible.
